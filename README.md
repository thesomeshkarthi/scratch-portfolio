# scratch-portfolio
A collection of all of the Scratch Projects I made in Middle School. Scratch is a free "drag and drop" coding software for youth to learn and get familiar with the art of coding. This is simply an HTML website showcasing some of the projects I made when I was younger. I have also attached the raw .sb3 files for anyone who has Scratch downloaded on their desktop.
